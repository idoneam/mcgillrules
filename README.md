# mcgillrules
/r/McGill Discord Rules, available as a single Markdown file (mostly)

## Usage

### rules.md
The messages meant to be posted in the `#rules` channel are in the rules.md file.

Note that this is written in *Discord*'s flavor of Markdown, with support for underlining with double underscores, and no support for things like headings, lists, images* or links. Furthermore, single line breaks should be interpreted as such and not be ignored (as they would be in standard Markdown). Triple line breaks divide the text in blocks that respect a Discord message's character limit. 

\* Markdown-style image syntax is used to specify when an image should be pasted in the channel, including the path to the specific file. Eventually, should we automate the whole updating process via Marty, this syntax provides everything needed for the bot to fetch the right file and send it as a message.

### get_verified.md
Just like for rules, this file contains the message posted to the `#get_verified` channel, to encourage members of the McGill community to verify their status.

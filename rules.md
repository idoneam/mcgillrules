We have several user-assignable roles available for users to identify their pronouns, year, fields of study, and interests.

To view a list of assignable roles, go to the #bots channel and type `?iam`. There are several categories of roles: `pronouns`, `fields`, `faculties`, `years`, and `generics`. You can view all roles within a specific category with e.g. `?iam pronouns`, and then assign a specific role with `?iam [Pronoun/Pronouns]`.

To un-assign a role, use the `?iamn [role]` command.

While we endeavour to protect the privacy of our users as much as possible, we cannot guarantee it. Therefore, be mindful about the information you share in this server, as we cannot reliably control who sees it. Discord as a platform stores posted images indefinitely, with public access to the URL, so be mindful of the images you post. Furthermore, even if you delete something, someone could always have screencapped it.
